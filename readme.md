# A High-Fidelity Metadata Streaming Framework for Virtual Production

> Portal Beam is a high-fidelity metadata streaming framework designed for virtual production pipelines. This versatile framework is built to support any hardware or software platform, streamlining the integration of virtual and real-world elements with high accuracy and efficiency.


## Core Capabilities

- **Universal Compatibility:** Interfaces seamlessly with a variety of sources, including SDI, Network/IP, Serial/I2C, NDI, and ST-2110, ensuring broad hardware and software compatibility.
- **Multi-Vendor Format Translation:** Capable of translating and integrating data from diverse vendor formats and standards, enhancing flexibility across different production tools and systems.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Employs real-time data processing with pre-defined functions for immediate responsiveness and efficiency in live production settings.

## Advanced Features

- **Enhanced Metadata Integration:** Includes comprehensive metadata like camera details, positional tracking, lens parameters, and synchronization information to ensure precise alignment of all production elements.
- **Dynamic Data Injection:** Allows nodes within the network to dynamically inject additional data into the stream, providing adaptability and real-time updates to production workflows.
- **Unique Frame Identifier (UFI):** Features a unique frame identifier for each frame, streamlining the linkage between different layers and composited elements, thereby facilitating iterative refinements and synchronizations.
- **AI-Enhanced Data Compression:** Utilizes AI algorithms to compress and decompress data streams, maintaining high pixel accuracy even over limited bandwidth, making it ideal for complex virtual production scenarios.
- **Multi-layer / Multi Stream Linking:** Supports the simultaneous linking of multiple layers of video feeds, FG, BG and overlays along with their respective metadata for advanced compositing and interaction.

## Conclusion

Portal Beam offers a comprehensive solution for managing and synchronizing high-quality visual, audio, and interactive elements in virtual production environments. By supporting a wide range of data sources and formats, coupled with advanced AI compression and real-time processing capabilities, it ensures efficient collaboration and high fidelity in data management, regardless of the underlying hardware or software platforms.
